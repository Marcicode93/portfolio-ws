Hosting</h2>\n  <p>We host the content of our website with the following provider:</p>\n\n  <h3>All-Inkl</h3>\n  <p>\n    The provider is ALL-INKL.COM - Neue Medien M\u00fcnnich, owned by Ren\u00e9 M\u00fcnnich,\n    Hauptstra\u00dfe 68, 02742 Friedersdorf (hereinafter referred to as All-Inkl).\n    For details, please refer to All-Inkl's privacy policy:\n    <a\n      href=\"https://all-inkl.com/datenschutzinformationen/\"\n      target=\"_blank\"\n      rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\n      >https://all-inkl.com/datenschutzinformationen/</a\n    >.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The use of All-Inkl is based on Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. We have a legitimate\n    interest in ensuring the most reliable presentation of our website. If\n    corresponding consent has been requested, processing is carried out\n    exclusively on the basis of Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR and Section 25 (1) TDDDG,\n    insofar as the consent includes the storage of cookies or access to\n    information on the user's device (e.g., device fingerprinting) within the\n    meaning of the TDDDG. Consent can be withdrawn at any time.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Data Processing Agreement</h3>\n  <p>\n    We have concluded a data processing agreement (DPA) for the use of the\n    aforementioned service. This is a contract required by data protection\n    law, which ensures that the provider processes the personal data of our\n    website visitors only according to our instructions and in compliance with\n    the GDPR.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>3. General Information and Mandatory Disclosures</h2>\n\n  <h3>Data Protection</h3>\n  <p>\n    The operators of this website take the protection of your personal data\n    very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in\n    accordance with statutory data protection regulations and this privacy\n    policy.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    When you use this website, various personal data is collected. Personal\n    data is data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy\n    policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also\n    explains how and for what purpose this happens.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    We point out that data transmission over the internet (e.g., communication\n    by email) may have security vulnerabilities. Complete protection of data\n    against access by third parties is not possible.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Information on the Controller</h3>\n  <p>The controller responsible for data processing on this website is:</p>\n  <p>\n    Marcel Steffen<br />Danziger Str. 12A<br />78166 Donaueschingen<br />Germany\n  </p>\n  <p>Phone: +4917620240491<br />Email: marcel.steffen\u0040hotmail.de</p>\n  <p>\n    The controller is the natural or legal person who, alone or jointly with\n    others, determines the purposes and means of processing personal data\n    (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Storage Duration</h3>\n  <p>\n    Unless a more specific storage period is stated within this privacy\n    policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data\n    processing no longer applies. If you assert a legitimate request for\n    deletion or withdraw your consent to data processing, your data will be\n    deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your\n    personal data (e.g., tax or commercial retention periods); in the latter\n    case, deletion will occur once these reasons no longer apply.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>\n    General Information on the Legal Basis for Data Processing on This Website\n  </h3>\n  <p>\n    If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data\n    based on Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR or Art. 9 (2) (a) GDPR, if special categories\n    of data under Art. 9 (1) GDPR are processed. In the case of explicit\n    consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, processing is\n    also based on Art. 49 (1) (a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage\n    of cookies or access to information on your device (e.g., via device\n    fingerprinting), processing is additionally based on Section 25 (1) TDDDG.\n    Consent can be withdrawn at any time. If your data is necessary for the\n    performance of a contract or for pre-contractual measures, we process your\n    data based on Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR. Furthermore, we process your data if it\n    is necessary to fulfill a legal obligation based on Art. 6 (1) (c) GDPR.\n    Data processing may also be carried out based on our legitimate interest\n    pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR. The relevant legal bases in each\n    individual case are explained in the following sections of this privacy\n    policy.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Recipients of Personal Data</h3>\n  <p>\n    In the course of our business activities, we work with various external\n    parties. This sometimes requires the transfer of personal data to these\n    external parties. We only transfer personal data to external parties if it\n    is necessary for the performance of a contract, if we are legally\n    obligated to do so (e.g., transfer of data to tax authorities), if we have\n    a legitimate interest under Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR in the transfer, or if\n    another legal basis permits the transfer. When using data processors, we\n    only transfer personal data of our customers based on a valid data\n    processing agreement. In cases of joint processing, a joint processing\n    agreement is concluded.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Withdrawal of Your Consent to Data Processing</h3>\n  <p>\n    Many data processing operations are only possible with your explicit\n    consent. You can withdraw consent you have already given at any time. The\n    legality of the data processing carried out prior to the withdrawal\n    remains unaffected by the withdrawal.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>\n    Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct\n    Marketing (Art. 21 GDPR)\n  </h3>\n  <p>\n    IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 (1) (E) OR (F) GDPR, YOU HAVE THE\n    RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME, FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR\n    SITUATION, TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO\n    PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH\n    PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE\n    WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN\n    DEMONSTRATE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING THAT OVERRIDE\n    YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR THE PROCESSING SERVES THE\n    ASSERTION, EXERCISE, OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO\n    ART. 21 (1) GDPR).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED FOR DIRECT MARKETING PURPOSES, YOU HAVE\n    THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA\n    CONCERNING YOU FOR SUCH MARKETING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING TO THE\n    EXTENT THAT IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT MARKETING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR\n    PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR DIRECT MARKETING\n    PURPOSES (OBJECTION PURSUANT TO ART. 21 (2) GDPR).\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Right to Lodge a Complaint with the Competent Supervisory Authority</h3>\n  <p>\n    In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have the right to\n    lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the\n    Member State of their habitual residence, place of work, or the place of\n    the alleged violation. The right to lodge a complaint exists without\n    prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>\n  <p>\n    You have the right to have data that we process automatically based on\n    your consent or in fulfillment of a contract handed over to you or a third\n    party in a common, machine-readable format. If you request the direct\n    transfer of the data to another controller, this will only be done to the\n    extent technically feasible.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Information, Rectification, and Deletion</h3>\n  <p>\n    Within the framework of applicable legal provisions, you have the right at\n    any time to free information about your stored personal data, its origin\n    and recipients, and the purpose of data processing, and, if applicable, a\n    right to rectification or deletion of this data. For this purpose and for\n    further questions regarding personal data, you can contact us at any time.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Right to Restriction of Processing</h3>\n  <p>\n    You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your\n    personal data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose. The right\n    to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:\n  </p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>\n      If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored by us, we\n      usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the verification,\n      you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your\n      personal data.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      If the processing of your personal data was/is unlawful, you can request\n      the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the\n      exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to\n      request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead\n      of deletion.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      If you have objected pursuant to Art. 21 (1) GDPR, a balancing of your\n      interests and ours must be carried out. As long as it is not yet clear\n      whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction\n      of the processing of your personal data.\n    </li>\n  </ul>\n  <p>\n    If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, this data \u2013\n    apart from its storage \u2013 may only be processed with your consent or for\n    the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection\n    of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of\n    important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>4. Data Collection on This Website</h2>\n\n  <h3>Cookies</h3>\n  <p>\n    Our website uses so-called \"cookies.\" Cookies are small data packets and\n    do not cause any damage to your device. They are stored either temporarily\n    for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent\n    cookies) on your device.

Permanent cookies remain stored on your device until you\n    delete them yourself or an automatic deletion occurs through your web\n    browser.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Cookies can originate from us (first-party cookies) or from third-party\n    companies (so-called third-party cookies). Third-party cookies enable the\n    integration of certain services from third-party companies within websites\n    (e.g., cookies for processing payment services).\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Cookies have various functions. Many cookies are technically necessary\n    because certain website functions would not work without them (e.g., the\n    shopping cart function or the display of videos). Other cookies can be\n    used to evaluate user behavior or for advertising purposes.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    Cookies that are necessary to carry out the electronic communication\n    process, to provide certain functions desired by you (e.g., for the\n    shopping cart function), or to optimize the website (e.g., cookies to\n    measure the web audience) (necessary cookies) are stored based on Art. 6\n    (1) (f) GDPR, unless another legal basis is specified. The website\n    operator has a legitimate interest in storing necessary cookies for the\n    technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. If consent\n    to the storage of cookies and comparable recognition technologies has been\n    requested, processing is carried out exclusively based on this consent\n    (Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR and Section 25 (1) TDDDG); consent can be withdrawn\n    at any time.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    You can set your browser to inform you about the setting of cookies and\n    allow cookies only in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies\n    for certain cases or generally, and activate the automatic deletion of\n    cookies when closing the browser. Disabling cookies may limit the\n    functionality of this website.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    You can find out which cookies and services are used on this website in\n    this privacy policy.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Contact Form</h3>\n  <p>\n    If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your details from the\n    inquiry form, including the contact details you provided there, will be\n    stored by us for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of\n    follow-up questions. We do not pass on this data without your consent.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR if your\n    inquiry is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for\n    pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on\n    our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the inquiries\n    addressed to us (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a)\n    GDPR) if this has been requested; consent can be withdrawn at any time.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you\n    request us to delete it, withdraw your consent to storage, or the purpose\n    for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your inquiry has been\n    processed). Mandatory statutory provisions – in particular retention\n    periods – remain unaffected.\n  </p>\n\n  <h3>Inquiry by Email, Telephone, or Fax</h3>\n  <p>\n    If you contact us by email, telephone, or fax, your inquiry, including all\n    resulting personal data (name, inquiry), will be stored and processed by\n    us for the purpose of handling your request. We do not pass on this data\n    without your consent.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR if your\n    inquiry is related to the performance of a contract or is necessary for\n    pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on\n    our legitimate interest in the effective processing of the inquiries\n    addressed to us (Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 (1) (a)\n    GDPR) if this has been requested; consent can be withdrawn at any time.\n  </p>\n  <p>\n    The data you send us via contact inquiries will remain with us until you\n    request us to delete it, withdraw your consent to storage, or the purpose\n    for data storage no longer applies (e.g., after your request has been\n    processed). Mandatory statutory provisions – in particular statutory\n    retention periods – remain unaffected.\n  </p>\n\n  <h2>5.
